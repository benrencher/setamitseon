Front end will use React to display epics and features.
	Feature
	- Has a title
	- short description of what it accomplishes
	- success criteria identified by developer
	- testing criteria identified by dev/qa
	- status: planning/to do/ done
	- epic parent: shows which epic it is a child of
	- priority: is it a must have or not?

	Epic
	- is linked to a group of features
	- 3 numbers: features in planning / features in progress / features done
	- estimate how long until completion of must have features
	- estimate how long until completion of all features

	Project
	- name
	- start time stamp
	- total number of epics
	- epics completed
	- estimate on how long it will take to complete all epic must haves
	- estimate on how long it will take to complete all epics

	Estimate
	- An eta based on cards complete / project up time * remaining cards
